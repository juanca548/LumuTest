# Failure Report

## [FE] - [Improvement] The section of report a bug and contact us redirect at the same site and this site doesnÂ´t have a form for report or send a comment

### Steps to reproduce

1. open [WordCounter](https://wordcounter.net/)
2. go to site map
3. click on "Contact us"
4. is displayed the section "contact us"
5. go to main page
6. click on "Report a Bug"
7. is displayed the section "contact us"

### Description

Both sections redirect to the same site and do not have at least one form to submit a comment or report a bug which makes these sections useless and does not allow contacting the admin in any way.

### Priority
